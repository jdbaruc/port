        <h3>Subscription Model</h3>

        <p>As mentioned in the <a href="na2.html">Native Access page</a>, one year into development of Native Access, came a top-down company-wide decision to roll out a subscription model [to select products]. We already needed more sprints than there are in a quarter to complete our roadmap and now we had to coordinate with many teams to deliver a 5000 user beta of subscription through Native Access. It quickly became apparent cross-department gaps in communication were frothing. The company had no channels or precedent for working in such close collaboration in such a short period of time. Measures were required. In a couple afternoons of that first week of subscription mania, I composed a <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/SFhthhhNXKnDPYkFij0t8b/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=TaR1v943e2QRc3YY-1">MIRO board</a> containing horizontal lanes for all tech and responsibly teams in the company and vertical lanes for the journey and the different products own respective parts of the journey. The board quickly became useful for the teams directly involved with the company's magnus opus and it also granted real-time visibility as a single source of truth for the entire company.
