                        Born in Vermont and raised in Westchester, New York. My post-college years I spent in Berlin. And as long as I can remember, I’ve been a designer.

                    <p style="font-weight:600;">
                        By my first year of college I was working at a small-but-mighty design firm, Lisaius Marketing, putting together campaigns and collateral for movies, exercise gear (GAIAM), and ski gear (Rossignol). Outside the office, I was building a reputation as a go-to-designer for local bands, art showcases, and conferences.

                    <p style="font-weight:500;">
                        My work took new shape in the entrepreneurial realm as I collaborated on product ideas with friends. Whether designing a “Yelp for promoters and venues,” exclusive guerilla marketing service, or gamified advertising app, conjuring rich experiences drove me.

                        For my college capstone, I conceptualized, incubated and developed an augmented reality software, Building Conversation. This app allowed architects, contractors, and patrons alike to envision a building project, the project’s details and the project’s implications its surroundings. Around this time, I became Director of Business Development for Together Festival, and culled partnerships and sponsorships to produce Boston’s premier music, art and technology conference.

                        After graduation, I started an invaluable design career at one of the most sought after  music technology companies, Native Instruments. A healthy portion of relics and artifacts from my time at Native Instruments has been salvaged and articulated through my portfolio.
